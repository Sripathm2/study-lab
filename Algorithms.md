# Algorithms — Implementation Notes

Idea, complexity, and notes for each algorithm in the `Algorithms/` package, reconciled against the code. Complexity claims describe **this repo's implementations** (e.g. the naive suffix-array build), with faster variants noted as upgrades. **Code flag** lines mark spots where the implementation deviates or has a known bug (details in `01_Mismatch_report.md`). Notes for the `Data_structures/` and `Problems/` packages live in their own files.

## Time complexity — growth rates worth recognizing

A quick reference for the growth rates that keep appearing in this repo, with the shapes that produce them. The question to ask of any loop or recursion: *how does the work shrink or accumulate as n grows?*

### O(1) — constant
Work independent of input size: array indexing, hash-table average lookup, heap peek, the sparse table's two-block query.

### O(log n) — halving
The input is **cut by a constant factor each step**, so the step count is "how many times can I halve n" = log₂ n. Doubling n adds *one* step. Recognize it in: binary search, BST/AVL walks (height of a balanced tree), heap sift up/down, Fenwick-tree loops (one step per set bit), the doubling branch of `Recursive_multiplication`, and each delta-phase count in capacity scaling (log of max capacity). Base of the log doesn't matter asymptotically — log₂, log₃, ln differ by a constant.

### O(√n) — square root
Work proportional to the root of the input — rarer, but a distinct shape worth spotting. Classic producers: **trial-division primality/factorization** (divisors pair up as d · n/d, so testing up to √n suffices), **square-root decomposition** (split an array into √n blocks of √n elements; a range query touches at most 2√n partial elements + √n whole blocks — the "poor man's segment tree"), and the baby-step-giant-step pattern (meet in the middle over √n-sized halves). Also the count of *distinct values* of ⌊n/k⌋ — a number-theory staple. Sits strictly between log n and n: for n = 10⁶, log n ≈ 20, √n = 1000, n = 10⁶.

### O(n) — linear
Touch every element a constant number of times: array scans, linked-list walks, `heapify` (the bottom-up build — perhaps surprisingly not n log n, because most nodes are near the bottom with short sift paths), Kasai's LCP, one BFS/DFS pass counting V+E as "the input size," Fenwick's O(n) constructor, `Three_way_min` (3T(n/3) + O(1) still visits every leaf).

### O(n log n) — linearithmic
The two canonical producers:
- **log n levels × O(n) work per level** — merge sort's recursion tree, the sparse table's build (log n rows × n cells).
- **n iterations × an O(log n) structure operation** — n heap pushes/pops (heapsort, lazy Prim/Dijkstra's heap traffic per edge), sorting-based algorithms in general (comparison sorting has an n log n lower bound), prefix-doubling suffix-array rounds.
Practically the "still fine at n = 10⁶–10⁷" class.

### Beyond
- **O(n²), O(n³)** — nested full scans: the naive LCP build, Floyd-Warshall's triple loop.
- **O(2ⁿ · n²), O(n!)** — subset DP (Held-Karp TSP) and permutation brute force; the wall where NP-hardness lives (see the NP-hardness note below).

Rule-of-thumb budget at ~10⁸ simple ops/sec: n ≤ 10⁶–10⁷ for n log n, n ≤ ~10⁴ for n², n ≤ ~500 for n³, n ≤ ~20 for 2ⁿ·n².

## Unique_substrings

Count the distinct non-empty substrings of a string.

### Idea
Every substring is a prefix of exactly one suffix. Across all suffixes there are `n(n+1)/2` prefixes — every substring counted *with* duplicates. Adjacent suffixes in sorted order share `lcp[i]` leading characters, and those shared prefixes are exactly the double-counts, so subtract them: `distinct = n(n+1)/2 − sum(lcp)`. The naive alternative (enumerate every substring into a hash set) is O(n³) time and O(n²) memory; this identity replaces all of it with one sum.

### Complexity
Dominated by the repo's **naive** suffix-array build: O(n² log n) time and O(n²) memory (all suffix strings are materialized; the LCP is direct adjacent comparison, not Kasai's). The final sum is O(n). With a prefix-doubling build + Kasai's, the whole thing drops to O(n log n) / O(n) — the upgrade path, not the current state.

### Notes
- The empty string short-circuits to 0; null throws.
- **Code flag (C1):** `n(n+1)/2` is computed in **`int`** (and the LCP sum via an int stream) even though the method returns `long` — it overflows once n passes ~65,535. The naive O(n²)-memory build gives out around the same scale, but the int math is the sharper cliff; compute both in `long`.


---

## Longest_repeated_substring

Find the longest substring that occurs at least twice.

### Idea
A repeated substring is a common prefix of two *distinct* suffixes, so the longest one has length `max(lcp)`. Recover it as that many leading characters of the suffix at the rank where the maximum sits (`suffixAt(rank)` hands the sorted suffix straight back).

### Complexity
Dominated by the naive suffix-array build: O(n² log n) time, O(n²) memory. The scan for the maximum LCP is O(n). (O(n log n) overall with the fast build.)

### Notes
- If `max(lcp) == 0` nothing repeats → return `""` (empty input also returns `""`; null throws).
- **Tie-break as implemented:** the scan uses strict `>`, so the *first* maximum in sorted-rank order wins — i.e. the lexicographically smallest of the tied longest repeats.


---

## Longest_common_substring

Find the longest substring appearing in at least k of n input strings (2 ≤ k ≤ n).

### Idea
Concatenate the strings with a unique sentinel after each — sentinels must be lexicographically smaller than every real character *and* mutually distinct, so no suffix compares equal across a boundary. **As implemented:** every real character is shifted **up** by `41 + numStrings`, and the sentinels are the raw code points `41, 42, 43, …` (one per string) — cheap guaranteed separation without hunting for unused characters; the final answer is shifted back down before returning.

Build the suffix array + LCP over the combined string, then color each suffix by which source string it came from. **As implemented:** a suffix's color is found by scanning it for the *first sentinel character it contains* — the nearest following boundary identifies the owner (an O(length) scan per suffix, O(N²) total; the positional arithmetic the textbook uses would be O(1) per suffix).

Slide a window over the sorted ranks, skipping suffixes that begin with a sentinel: the substring shared by every suffix in a window has length equal to the minimum LCP strictly inside the window. Keep a `color → count` table; grow the window until it covers ≥ k distinct colors, then shrink from the left while recording candidates. The window-min LCP is the candidate length; keep the longest, recovered from the suffix at the window's left edge.

### Complexity
Dominated by the naive suffix-array build over the combined length N: O(N² log N) time, O(N²) memory. The window scan **as implemented** keeps the running minimum in the repo's own `Priority_queue` — whose `remove` is an O(size) scan — so the scan itself is up to O(N²) too (a monotonic deque or a sparse table over the LCP array would make it O(N), the standard upgrade).

### Notes
- The ≥ k colors test sorts the count table's values and checks that the k-th largest is nonzero.
- k = n is the all-strings case; k = 2 is "shared by any pair." If no window ever reaches k colors, return `""`.
- **Code flag (C2):** the "does this suffix start with a sentinel?" test compares against `'A' + 41 + numStrings`, which silently assumes every input character is ≥ `'A'` — digits, spaces, or punctuation below `'A'` would be misclassified as sentinels. Fine for the letter-only tests; a real fix compares against the true smallest shifted character (or uses positional coloring).

## Divide and conquer

A problem-solving technique: break a problem into smaller, independent subproblems of the *same type*, solve each (usually recursively), then combine their answers into the final result. It's recursion with a specific shape — split into multiple subproblems and merge.

### Idea
Three steps:
- **Divide** — split the input into subproblems. Often two halves, but it can be any number of parts (a *k-way* split into thirds, quarters, etc.).
- **Conquer** — solve each subproblem recursively; a base case handles inputs small enough to answer directly.
- **Combine** — merge the sub-results into the answer for the whole.

The combine step is what distinguishes divide-and-conquer from plain single-branch recursion: there are several subproblems and their results have to be reconciled (the merge in merge sort, the min-of-parts in Three_way_min, the cross-boundary case in maximum-subarray).

### Complexity
Cost follows a recurrence `T(n) = a·T(n/b) + f(n)`, where `a` = number of subproblems, `n/b` = subproblem size, and `f(n)` = divide + combine work. The **Master Theorem** solves the common shapes:
- Merge sort — `T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)` → O(n log n).
- Binary search — `T(n) = T(n/2) + O(1)` → O(log n).
- Three-way min — `T(n) = 3T(n/3) + O(1)` → O(n) (implemented in `Problems/`, see `Problems_notes.md`).

Splitting more ways doesn't beat O(n) when every element must be examined (as in min/max) — the split count changes the recursion tree's shape, not the fact that all `n` leaves get visited. Divide-and-conquer wins big when the combine step lets you *discard* work (binary search) or when a clever merge beats the naive bound (Karatsuba, FFT).

### Applications
Merge sort, quicksort, binary search, maximum-subarray, closest pair of points, Karatsuba integer multiplication, Strassen matrix multiplication, and the fast Fourier transform.


---

## Merge_sort

Sort a 1D array with divide and conquer: split in half, sort each half recursively, then merge the two sorted halves.

### Idea
Maps directly onto divide / conquer / combine:
- **Divide** — split the range at the midpoint `(lo + hi) / 2`.
- **Conquer** — recursively merge-sort each half. Base case: a single-element range returns a fresh one-element array (a *copy*, so the caller's array is never aliased or touched).
- **Combine** — **merge** two sorted halves into one sorted array with a two-pointer walk: compare the current front of each half, take the smaller, advance that pointer; when one half runs out, copy the rest of the other. This merge is the whole trick — it turns two sorted pieces into one in linear time.

The recursion tree has `log n` levels, and each level does O(n) total merging work across all its pieces — that's the shape of the cost.

### Complexity
`T(n) = 2·T(n/2) + O(n)` → **O(n log n)** time in the worst, average, and best case (it always splits and always merges). Space is O(n) per level of live merge buffers — this version allocates a new array at every merge rather than reusing one shared temp buffer. It is **stable**: the merge takes from the left half on ties (`<=`, not `<`), so equal elements keep their original relative order.

### Notes
- **Stability hinges on that merge tie rule.** Not observable for bare `int`s, but it matters when sorting records by a key.
- **Top-down vs bottom-up.** This recursive form is top-down. Bottom-up merge sort iterates, merging runs of size 1, 2, 4, … — same O(n log n), no recursion stack.
- **Allocation.** Returning new arrays at each level is the clearest form; the standard optimization is one shared temp buffer allocated once. True in-place merge is possible but intricate and rarely worth it.
- **Non-destructive contract here:** the input array is provably unchanged after sorting (the runner verifies), because every level works on copies. Empty input returns a new empty array; null throws.
- **Generic version.** Swap `int[]` for `T[]` with `T extends Comparable<T>` (or a `Comparator`) and compare via `compareTo` — the structure is identical.

# Graphs — Overview

A **graph** is a set of vertices (nodes) connected by edges. It's the most general of the structures here: trees, linked lists, and grids are all special cases. Almost any "things and the relationships between them" problem is a graph problem.

## Kinds of graphs
- **Undirected** — edges have no direction; `u—v` means you can travel both ways.
- **Directed (digraph)** — edges are one-way arrows; `u→v` does not imply `v→u`.
- **Weighted** — each edge carries a value (cost, distance, capacity). Unweighted graphs are the weight-1 special case.
- **Tree** — a connected, acyclic undirected graph; `n` vertices and exactly `n−1` edges, with a unique path between any two vertices.
- **Rooted tree** — a tree with one vertex designated the root, giving every edge a direction: an **out-tree** (edges point away from the root, the usual case) or an **in-tree** (edges point toward the root).
- **DAG (directed acyclic graph)** — a digraph with no directed cycles. Models dependencies/orderings; admits a topological sort and underlies most DP-on-graphs.
- **Bipartite** — vertices split into two sets with edges only *between* the sets. Equivalent to being **2-colorable** and to having **no odd-length cycle**.
- **Complete graph** — every pair of distinct vertices is joined by exactly one edge (`n(n−1)/2` edges undirected).

## Representations
How you store the graph drives every algorithm's cost. Let `V` = vertices, `E` = edges.

- **Adjacency matrix** — a `V × V` grid; cell `(u, v)` holds the edge (presence/weight). Edge and weight lookup **O(1)**, but **O(V²)** memory and iterating all edges is **O(V²)**. Best for **dense** graphs.
- **Adjacency list** — each vertex stores a list of its outgoing edges. **O(V + E)** memory; iterating a vertex's neighbors is **O(degree)**; a specific edge lookup is **O(degree)**. Best for **sparse** graphs (the common case).
- **Edge list** — a flat list of `(u, v, w)` triples. Compact, natural for algorithms that sweep all edges (Kruskal), poor for "who are v's neighbors?".

## Problems & algorithms this unlocks
- **Shortest path** — BFS (unweighted), Dijkstra (non-negative weights), Bellman-Ford (handles negatives), Floyd-Warshall (all pairs), one-pass relaxation on DAGs.
- **Detecting negative cycles** — Bellman-Ford and Floyd-Warshall flag them.
- **Strongly connected components** — Tarjan's / Kosaraju's on digraphs.
- **Traveling salesman** — min-cost tour visiting every vertex (Held-Karp DP).
- **Bridges and articulation points** — a **bridge** is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components; the vertex analogue is an **articulation point**. Found with a DFS low-link pass.
- **Minimum spanning tree** — cheapest edge set connecting all vertices (Kruskal, Prim).
- **Maximum flow** — most flow routable from source to sink (Ford-Fulkerson family / Dinic's).

The two representations are implemented in `Data_structures/` — full Positives/Negatives/Algorithm notes for them are in `Data_structures_notes.md`.

Most of these build on two traversals — **DFS** and **BFS** — so those come first.


---

## Depth_first_search

Traverse a graph by diving as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking. DFS is the workhorse behind connectivity, cycle detection, topological sort, bridges/articulation points, and strongly connected components.

### Idea
**As implemented: iterative, with the repo's own `Stack`, producing preorder.**

```
push start
while stack not empty:
    v = pop
    if v not visited:
        mark v visited; record v          # preorder = order of first visits
        push v's neighbors in REVERSE order
```

Two implementation choices carry the behavior:
- **Reverse-order pushing.** Popping is LIFO, so pushing neighbors high-to-low makes the *lowest* neighbor pop first — the traversal explores ascending neighbors exactly like the recursive form would.
- **Mark on pop, guard on pop.** A vertex can sit in the stack multiple times (once per discovering neighbor); the `if not visited` check on pop discards the duplicates. The stack can hold up to O(E) entries, but each vertex expands once and each edge pushes once, so the work is still O(V+E).

The **visited set** is essential regardless of style: without it, cycles loop forever and shared vertices reprocess.

Built on top of `preorder`:
- **reachable(start)** — run the traversal, mark everything it returned: the set reachable from `start`, verbatim.
- **componentCount()** — repeatedly launch `preorder` from a not-yet-covered vertex, merging each result into a global visited set, until every vertex is covered. Each launch is one **connected component** (meaningful for undirected graphs; for digraphs the analogous notion is SCCs, which need Tarjan's).

There is **no postorder function** in this file — reverse-postorder lives where it's needed, in `Topological_sort_dfs`.

### Complexity
O(V + E) — each vertex expands once, each edge is pushed once (twice for undirected, once per stored direction). O(V) for visited plus up-to-O(E) stack entries in the duplicate-tolerant style.

### Notes
- **Iterative vs recursive:** same order, same cost; the explicit stack sidesteps stack-overflow on deep graphs (V ~ 10⁵ paths), which is exactly why this form was chosen.
- **DFS vs BFS.** Both O(V+E), both visit everything reachable; they differ in *order*. DFS (stack — deep first) feeds topological sort, cycle detection, low-link algorithms. BFS (queue — level by level) gives shortest paths in **unweighted** graphs; DFS does not.
- **Determinism.** Ascending neighbor visits make runs reproducible — currently guaranteed by the reverse-push plus how tests build graphs (see the adjacency-list ordering flag).


---

## Breadth_first_search

Traverse a graph level by level: the start, then everything one edge away, then two, and so on. Because it reaches vertices in order of increasing distance, BFS gives **shortest paths in unweighted graphs** — and recording where each vertex was first seen lets you rebuild the path.

### Idea
**As implemented — a mark-on-dequeue variant with a parent guard:**

```
parent[*] = -1;  parent[start] = -2          # -2 marks the ROOT; -1 = undiscovered
enqueue start
while queue not empty:
    v = dequeue
    if v not visited:
        mark v visited; record v in order
        for each neighbor w of v (list order):
            if parent[w] == -1: parent[w] = v   # first discovery wins
            enqueue w                            # enqueued unconditionally
```

The textbook discipline is to mark visited **on enqueue** so each vertex enters the queue once; this code marks **on dequeue** instead and lets duplicates into the queue. It stays correct for shortest paths because of the `parent[w] == -1` guard: a vertex's parent is set the *first* time any processed vertex sees it, and processed vertices leave the queue in nondecreasing distance order — so the recorded parent always lies on a shortest path. The price is a fatter queue (up to O(E) entries) and redundant pops; total work is still O(V+E). Worth knowing both styles: mark-on-enqueue is the leaner discipline, this one trades queue size for a simpler loop.

**There is no `dist[]` array.** Distance and path both come from the parent chain:
- **shortestPath(start, target)** — run the BFS, then walk `parent` backward from `target` until hitting the `-2` root marker, and reverse. `start == target` short-circuits to `[start]`; an undiscovered target (`parent == -1`) returns an empty array (no path).
- **shortestPath_compute_once** — the same backward walk *without* re-running the BFS; it reuses the `parent` state left by a prior `order()` call (the parent array is a static field — see notes).
- **distances(start)** — runs the BFS once, then for every vertex reconstructs its path and returns `length − 1`, with **−1 as the unreachable sentinel** (empty path → 0 − 1). Reconstructing per-vertex makes this **O(V²)** worst case (sum of all path lengths) — a `dist[]` filled during the BFS would be the O(V+E) version.

### Complexity
O(V + E) time for the traversal itself (each edge enqueues once, duplicates pop in O(1)); O(E) worst-case queue. `distances()` is O(V²) worst case as described.

### Notes
- **`parent[start] = -2`** is the root marker and the stop condition of every backward walk; `-1` strictly means "never discovered."
- **Shortest paths hold only for unweighted graphs** (or all-equal weights). BFS counts *edges*; with varying weights you need Dijkstra. The "first time reached = shortest" guarantee comes from level-by-level FIFO order.
- **Ties.** When several shortest paths exist, which one you get depends on neighbor order and first-parent-wins. All are equally short; the length is unique even though the path isn't.
- **Static state (C9):** `parent` is a static field shared across calls — `shortestPath_compute_once` silently depends on which `order()` ran last, and nothing is thread-safe. Fine for a study repo; a returned parent array would be the cleaner API.
- **BFS vs DFS.** Same O(V+E), opposite order: queue (wide) vs stack (deep). BFS → unweighted shortest paths, level structure, bipartite checks. DFS → topo sort, cycle detection, SCC. Reach for BFS whenever "fewest edges" or "closest first" matters.


---

## Root_tree

Turn an undirected tree (adjacency lists) into a rooted `Tree_node` structure by choosing a root and orienting every edge away from it.

### Idea
An undirected tree has no inherent parent/child direction — that appears only once you pick a root. **As implemented: iterative, with the repo's `Stack`, belt-and-suspenders guards.**

```
push new Tree_node(root, null)
while stack not empty:
    node = pop
    if node.id not visited:
        mark visited
        for each neighbor w of node.id:
            if node has a parent and w == parent.id: continue    # don't walk back up
            child = new Tree_node(w, node); node.children.add(child); push child
```

Children are attached at push time in adjacency order, so a node's `children` list mirrors its neighbor list (minus the parent) regardless of pop order. The root's parent is `null`, hence the `parent != null` guard before the skip test.

### Complexity
O(n) — each vertex and edge touched once. The explicit stack replaces recursion depth (a path-shaped tree would be O(n) deep).

### Notes
- **Two guards where one would do:** in a genuine tree, the skip-the-parent check alone suffices (no other cycles exist) and each node is pushed exactly once — the `visited[]` array is redundant. It's cheap insurance: on malformed input (a cycle), it prevents infinite work, though the resulting "tree" would still contain duplicate ids. Contract says tree; the guard just makes failure graceful.
- **Re-rooting the same tree gives a different structure.** Parent/child relationships are relative to the root; rooting at a leaf vs. the center produces different shapes of the same underlying tree.
- Validation: null adjacency throws, empty graph rejected, root bounds-checked.


---

## Leaf_node_sum

Sum the ids of all leaves in a rooted tree (a leaf is a node with no children).

### Idea
A post-order recursion: a node with no children is a leaf and contributes its own id; otherwise it contributes the summed contributions of its subtrees.

```
sum(node):
    if node is a leaf: return node.id
    return sum over children of sum(child)
```

### Complexity
O(n) time, O(height) stack. Sums in `long`.

### Notes
- **A single-node tree is a leaf** — its root has no children, so it contributes its own id. Handle that base case; don't assume "root = internal."
- Trivially adapts to summing a stored value, counting leaves, or finding the deepest leaf — same tree walk, different per-node contribution.


---

## Tree_center

Find the 1 or 2 vertices at the middle of an undirected tree (the center of its longest path).

### Idea
Peel leaves inward. Repeatedly remove every current leaf (degree ≤ 1) as a whole layer, decrementing neighbors' degrees so new leaves surface, until at most 2 vertices remain. The survivors are the center(s) — a tree always has exactly one or two, depending on whether its longest path has an odd or even number of vertices.

**As implemented:**
```
degree[v] = adj[v].size();  leaves = all v with degree <= 1;  removed = leaves.size()
while removed < n:
    next = []
    for each leaf: for each neighbor: degree[neigh]--
        if degree[neigh] <= 1 and not already processed and not already in next: next.add(neigh)
    mark this layer processed;  leaves = next;  removed += next.size()
return leaves
```

The `processed[]` flag plus the not-already-queued check stop a vertex from entering a layer twice when several of its leaf-neighbors peel simultaneously.

### Complexity
O(n) peel overall — each vertex leaves the frontier once. (One implementation nit: the `newleaves.contains` duplicate check is a linear scan of the layer; a boolean "queued" array would keep the layer-building strictly O(degree). Correctness unaffected.)

### Notes
- **Always 1 or 2 centers.** Odd-vertex longest path → one; even → two adjacent. Never zero, never three.
- **Small trees are base cases handled by the loop condition:** `n == 1` → the lone vertex (which enters `leaves` via the `degree == 0` case); `n == 2` → both. Neither enters the while loop.
- This is the "trim leaves layer by layer" idea (a.k.a. minimum-height-trees) — the center minimizes tree height when chosen as root, which is exactly why Tree_isomorphism roots there.


---

## Tree_isomorphism

Decide whether two undirected trees have the same shape, ignoring vertex labels.

### Idea
Use the **AHU (Aho–Hopcroft–Ullman) canonical encoding**. First reduce the unrooted problem to a rooted one by rooting each tree at its **center** — isomorphic trees have corresponding centers, so this anchors the comparison label-independently. Then encode each rooted tree canonically:

```
encode(node):
    labels = [ encode(child) for each child ]
    sort labels                       # sibling order must not matter
    return "(" + concat(labels) + ")"
```

A leaf encodes as `"()"`. Two rooted trees are isomorphic **iff their encodings are identical** — sorting the child labels at every node is what makes the string independent of arbitrary neighbor order.

**Handling two centers, as implemented:** tree A is rooted at its *first* center only and encoded once; tree B is rooted at *each* of its centers in turn, and the trees match if either of B's encodings equals A's. (Trying both on one side suffices — which center corresponds to which isn't known in advance, but A's first center must map to *one* of B's.)

### Complexity
Center + rooting are O(n). Encoding sorts child label strings at every node — O(n log n) comparisons, up to O(n²) characters in the concatenation worst case (long path); fine at these sizes.

### Notes
- **Different sizes → immediately not isomorphic** (checked first); two empty trees count as isomorphic.
- **Root at the center, not an arbitrary vertex.** Rooting both at vertex 0 would compare structure relative to labels — wrong.
- **Sorting siblings is essential.** Without it, the same tree with children listed in a different order produces a different string and falsely reads non-isomorphic.
- Verified pairs in the runner: relabeled A ≅ B, A ≇ path, star ≇ path, single ≅ single.


---

## Lowest_common_ancestor

The lowest common ancestor of `u` and `v` in a rooted tree is the deepest node that is an ancestor of both.

### Idea
**As implemented: Euler tour + sparse-table range-minimum — O(1) per query after O(n log n) preprocessing.** (This is the many-queries method; the simple "equalize depths and climb parents" alternative is sketched in the notes below.)

The classical reduction: LCA on a tree **is** a range-minimum query on its Euler tour.

**Preprocessing (constructor):**
1. Root the tree with `Root_tree`.
2. DFS the rooted tree recording an **Euler tour**: visit the node on entry, and again after *each* child returns. Two parallel lists grow together — `nodes` (the tour) and `depth` (that visit's depth) — plus a `last[id] = tour index` map recording each node's most recent appearance (any occurrence works; last is what the code keeps).
3. Build the repo's `Sparse_table` over the `depth` list with `Integer::min` — its index-tracking argmin variant (`queryOverlap_index_min_operation_only`) exists precisely for this.

**Query `lca(u, v)`:** take `l = min(last[u], last[v])`, `r = max(...)`. Between any occurrence of `u` and any occurrence of `v`, the tour walks down and up through their meeting point — the **shallowest node in that tour window is exactly the LCA**. One O(1) argmin over `depth[l..r]`, then read `nodes[that index].id`.

### Complexity
O(n) tour (length 2n−1) + O(n log n) sparse-table build; **O(1) per query**. Preprocessing memory O(n log n).

### Notes
- **Why RMQ works:** the tour enters the LCA's subtree before touching `u` or `v` and can't leave it between them, and the LCA is the unique minimum-depth vertex the walk passes through on the way from one to the other. Idempotent min → the sparse table's two overlapping blocks answer it in O(1).
- **Ancestry is relative to the root.** Re-rooting changes every LCA. Root once (constructor), query many — the shape this class enforces.
- `lca(u, u) == u` falls out for free (a window of width... `l == r` — the argmin of one cell is that cell). Out-of-range ids throw.
- **The zero-structure alternative** (record `parent[]` + `depth[]`, lift the deeper node, then climb in lockstep) is O(height) per query with no extra machinery — the right tool when queries are few; **binary lifting** (O(log n)/query after O(n log n)) sits between the two.
- The DFS recursion is O(height) deep — a path-shaped tree recurses n deep; fine at test sizes.

## Topological_sort_dfs

A topological ordering of a DAG lists its vertices so that every edge `u → v` has `u` before `v`. (Only directed *acyclic* graphs have one.)

### Idea
DFS; a vertex is emitted when it **finishes** (after all its descendants are done), and reverse-finish-order is a topological order: a vertex finishes only after everything reachable from it, so reversing puts it before them.

**As implemented:**
```
for each unvisited vertex i: dfs(i, launch = i)
dfs(v, launch):
    if v == launch and v is visited: throw     # cycle returned to the launch vertex
    if v visited: return
    mark v visited
    for each out-neighbor w: dfs(w, launch)
    order.add(0, v)                            # PREPEND on finish
```

Two departures from the textbook sketch:
- **Prepend instead of reverse.** Emitting each finished vertex at the *front* of the list yields the topological order directly — no reversal step to forget. The cost: `ArrayList.add(0, ·)` shifts the whole list, so order-building is O(V²) in the worst case (an `ArrayDeque.addFirst`, or append + reverse, is the O(V) version).
- **Cycle detection is only partial — code flag (B4).** The only check is "the recursion returned to the very vertex this DFS was launched from." A cycle that doesn't pass through a launch vertex is missed entirely: `0→1→2→1` quietly returns `[0, 1, 2]` even though no valid ordering exists. Full detection needs the third color — *in-progress* (on the current recursion stack) vs *done* — where any edge to an in-progress vertex is a back edge ⇒ cycle. Two colors genuinely aren't enough: an edge to a *done* vertex is a harmless cross/forward edge; only the on-stack case is a cycle.

`sort_with_start_node(g, start)` runs the launch loop but starts with a preferred vertex first — used by the DAG shortest-path code so the source's reachable region is ordered before the strays; remaining unvisited vertices still get launched afterward, so the order always covers all V vertices.

### Complexity
O(V + E) traversal + O(V²) worst-case list prepending. O(V) recursion depth (deep DAGs can overflow the stack; Kahn's is the iterative escape).

### Notes
- The output isn't unique; any order respecting all edges is valid — runners should verify the edge property, not one fixed sequence.
- State is static (`order`, `visited`) — one sort at a time (C9).
- **DFS-topo vs Kahn's:** same O(V+E), same "any valid order." This one is terser and naturally produces the reverse-postorder that SCC algorithms also use; Kahn's is iterative (no stack-depth risk), detects *all* cycles for free, and its intermediate state (currently-available vertices) is meaningful.


---

## Topological_sort_kahn

Same goal — a topological order of a DAG — built with in-degrees and a queue instead of recursion.

### Idea
A vertex can come next exactly when it has no remaining incoming edges. Compute every vertex's **in-degree** (one sweep over all adjacency lists), seed a queue with the in-degree-0 vertices, then repeatedly dequeue one, append it to the order, and "remove" its outgoing edges by decrementing each out-neighbor's in-degree — enqueuing any that drop to 0.

```
compute indeg[v] for all v
queue = all v with indeg[v] == 0
while queue not empty:
    v = dequeue; order.add(v)
    for each out-neighbor w: indeg[w]--; if indeg[w] == 0: enqueue w
if order.size() < V: cycle -> THROW IllegalArgumentException
```

### Complexity
O(V + E) — each vertex enqueued once, each edge relaxed once. O(V) for the queue and in-degree array. Fully iterative — no recursion-depth risk.

### Notes
- **The count is the cycle test — and here it catches *every* cycle.** Vertices trapped in a cycle never reach in-degree 0, so the loop emits fewer than V and the code throws (contrast with the DFS version's partial detection, flag B4). No coloring needed.
- **Determinism:** swapping the plain queue for a min-priority queue yields the lexicographically smallest valid order, if a canonical one is ever needed.
- Uses the repo's own `Queue`; state is static (C9).
- **Code flag (C10):** this file also contains a full copy-paste duplicate of `Root_tree.rootTree` — a straggler from a working session; delete it and import the real one.

## Dag_shortest_longest_path

Single-source shortest (or longest) path in a **weighted DAG**. Because the graph is acyclic, one relaxation pass in topological order solves it — no priority queue, no repeated passes, and negative weights are fine.

### Idea
Two steps:
1. **Topologically sort**, via `Topological_sort_dfs.sort_with_start_node(g, source)` — the source-first variant, so the source's region is ordered before unreachable strays (which still appear in the order and must be skipped during relaxation).
2. **Relax edges in topo order.** `dist[source] = 0`, everything else at a sentinel; walk vertices in order, relaxing each outgoing edge `u → v` with `dist[u] + w < dist[v]`.

Why one pass works: in topological order, **every edge into `u` comes from a vertex that appears earlier**, so by the time `u` is processed, `dist[u]` is final. That's the whole payoff of acyclicity.

**Longest paths, as implemented: the negation trick.** `longestPaths` negates every edge weight, runs the same shortest-path relaxation, and negates the results at the end. (The equivalent alternative — flip the comparison and start from −∞ — isn't what this code does.) A convenient accident makes the sentinel survive: `UNREACHABLE_LONGEST = Long.MIN_VALUE`, and `MIN_VALUE * −1` overflows back to `MIN_VALUE`, so untouched vertices keep their sentinel through the final negation.

### Complexity
O(V + E) — topo sort plus one pass over every edge. Beats Dijkstra's O((V+E) log V) and, unlike Dijkstra, tolerates negative weights (a DAG can't contain a negative cycle — it can't contain any cycle). Distances accumulate in `long`.

### Notes
- **Only for DAGs.** With a cycle no topological order exists. Caveat inherited from flag B4: the underlying DFS topo sort only *throws* for cycles through a launch vertex — other cyclic graphs will be silently "ordered" and produce garbage distances. Kahn's underneath would make the not-a-DAG rejection airtight.
- **Skip unreachable vertices during relaxation.** `shortestPaths` does this correctly (`continue` when `dist[u]` is the sentinel — adding a weight to "infinity" is meaningless and overflows).
  **Code flag (B5):** `longestPaths` is missing that guard. `Long.MIN_VALUE + weight` wraps to a huge positive, and the `|| dist[neigh] == UNREACHABLE_LONGEST` clause then happily installs the garbage — so an unreachable vertex fed by another unreachable vertex reports a bogus finite "longest path" instead of the sentinel (reproduced: source 0 with a disconnected edge 1→2 yields −9223372036854775803 at vertex 2). One `continue` fixes it.
- **Use `long` for distances** and keep sentinels out of arithmetic — the two rules this pair of methods demonstrates by having one follow them and one not.
- Verified in the runner: shortest from 0 → `[0,2,3,9,6,8,∞]`, longest → `[0,2,4,9,10,14,−∞]`; a negative-weight DAG routes through the −4 edge.

## Dijkstra

Single-source shortest paths on a graph with **non-negative** edge weights.

### Idea
Greedily settle vertices in increasing distance order. Keep tentative distances; repeatedly pop the unsettled vertex with the smallest tentative distance from a priority queue, finalize it, and relax its outgoing edges. Once a vertex is popped it's done — its distance can never improve, **because all weights are non-negative**, so no later, longer-prefix path can undercut it.

**As implemented** — `java.util.PriorityQueue` over `(vertex, dist)` pairs ordered by distance, with both a lazy-deletion skip *and* a visited array:

```
dist[source] = 0, rest = Long.MAX_VALUE (UNREACHABLE);  pq = {(source, 0)}
while pq not empty:
    (u, d) = pop-min;  visited[u] = true
    if dist[u] < d: continue                 # stale entry, skip
    for each edge u->v:  if visited[v]: continue
        if dist[u] + w < dist[v]: dist[v] = dist[u] + w; push (v, dist[v])
```

### Complexity
O((V + E) log V) with the binary heap. An indexed PQ with decrease-key (the repo's `Indexed_priority_queue` fits exactly) trims heap size from O(E) to O(V); "push duplicates, skip stale" is simpler and asymptotically the same.

### Notes
- **Non-negative weights only.** A single negative edge breaks the settled-is-final invariant — Bellman-Ford handles those.
- **Lazy deletion:** rather than decrease-key, push a fresh `(v, dist)` on every improvement and discard a popped entry whose stored distance is worse than the current `dist[u]`. The `visited[]` skip on neighbors is belt-and-suspenders — the stale check alone suffices; skipping visited neighbors just avoids pointless pushes.
- Unreachable vertices keep the `Long.MAX_VALUE` sentinel; distances accumulate in `long` so sentinel + weight is never computed (relaxation only proceeds from popped, hence reachable, vertices).


---

## Bellman_ford

Single-source shortest paths that tolerates **negative** weights and detects negative cycles.

### Idea
A shortest path uses at most `V−1` edges, so relaxing **every edge** `V−1` times settles all finite shortest distances (each pass extends the correct frontier by at least one edge). Then run `V−1` **more** passes: any edge that can *still* relax means its target is reachable from a negative cycle — mark those `NEGATIVE_INF` and let the marker propagate (a vertex fed by a −∞ vertex is also −∞, hence full sweeps, not one pass).

**As implemented:** edges are iterated as "for every vertex, for every out-neighbor" over the `Graph` interface (adjacency form of the same edge sweep). Two methods share the skeleton:
- `shortestPaths` — phase 1 relaxes with a `dist[u] != UNREACHABLE` guard; phase 2 marks `NEGATIVE_INF` where improvement is still possible.
- `hasNegativeCycle` — same two phases, returning whether phase 2 ever fired.

### Complexity
O(V·E) — `V−1` sweeps twice. Slower than Dijkstra; that's the price of negatives.

### Notes
- **Guard every relaxation against the sentinels** — `UNREACHABLE + w` overflows `long` and leaks a bogus finite distance. This is the rule; the implementation applies it unevenly:
  **Code flag (B6):** `shortestPaths`' **phase 2** has no `UNREACHABLE` guard — `MAX_VALUE + w` wraps negative and "improves," so a merely-unreachable vertex fed by another unreachable vertex gets falsely branded `NEGATIVE_INF` (reproduced with a disconnected edge 1→2, source 0). Mirror problem in `hasNegativeCycle`: its **phase 1** lacks the guard, so wrapped values contaminate distances there instead — and on the same graph the two methods disagree (`shortestPaths` shows a −∞; `hasNegativeCycle` says false). Both fixes are the same one-line guard phase 2 of `hasNegativeCycle` already has in spirit.
- **Two-phase detection** is the elegant part: "still improving after V−1 passes" *is* the negative-cycle witness, and running the marking phase V−1 times is what propagates −∞ to everything downstream of the cycle.
- **Early exit optimization** (stop when a full pass changes nothing) isn't implemented — worth adding; it makes the common no-negative-cycle case much faster.

## Floyd_warshall

**All-pairs** shortest paths; handles negative edges and detects negative cycles.

### Idea
Allow paths to route through intermediate vertices `0, 1, …, k` one at a time. After incorporating intermediate `k`, `dp[i][j]` is the shortest path using only intermediates from `{0..k}`. The update: could `i → k → j` beat the current `i → j`?

```
dp[i][j] = 0 on the diagonal, weight(i,j) if the edge exists, else UNREACHABLE
for k: for i: for j:
    if dp[i][k], dp[k][j] both finite and dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] < dp[i][j]:
        dp[i][j] = that sum
```

**k must be the outermost loop** — the DP relies on `dp[i][k]` and `dp[k][j]` being final for the current `k` before moving on.

**Negative-cycle handling, as implemented:** after the main triple loop, run the **same triple loop again**; any cell that can *still* improve lies on a path through a negative cycle → set it to `NEGATIVE_INF`. (The equivalent classic check — `dp[i][i] < 0` flags vertex `i` on a negative cycle — isn't what this code uses; the rerun-and-detect-improvement sweep subsumes it and directly marks affected *pairs*.)

### Complexity
O(V³) time (twice, with the detection sweep), O(V²) space. Beats running single-source algorithms from every vertex once the graph is dense, and it's dead simple to code.

### Notes
- **Overflow guard:** both loops skip when either operand is `UNREACHABLE` — the sentinel discipline done right here (contrast Bellman-Ford's flag B6).
- **Code flag (C10):** the code also fills a `path[][]` next-vertex matrix for route reconstruction (`path[i][j] = path[i][k]` on improvement, −1 through negative cycles) — but never returns or exposes it. Dead weight: either add a `reconstructPath(i, j)` or drop the matrix.
- **Code flag (B9):** `hasNegativeCycle`'s initialization is missing an `else` — `if (i==j){dp=0} if (hasEdge){...} else {UNREACHABLE}` — so a diagonal cell without a self-loop is set to 0 and immediately overwritten with `UNREACHABLE`. `allPairsShortestPaths` has the correct `else if` chain; make them match.

## Tarjan_scc

Strongly connected components of a **directed** graph in a single DFS. An SCC is a maximal set of vertices where every vertex can reach every other.

### Idea
DFS the graph, assigning each vertex an increasing **discovery index** and a **low value** — the smallest index reachable from its DFS subtree using edges into vertices still on an auxiliary **stack**. Push each vertex on first visit. When a vertex `u` finishes with `low[u] == index[u]`, it's the **root** of an SCC: pop the stack down to and including `u` — those vertices are exactly one component.

**As implemented:**
```
dfs(u):
    ids[u] = low[u] = counter++;  push u;  onStack[u] = true
    for each edge u->v:
        if v unvisited: dfs(v)
        if onStack[v]: low[u] = min(low[u], low[v])     # one rule for tree AND back edges
    if ids[u] == low[u]:                                # u roots an SCC
        pop the stack down through u; each popped vertex gets low[] = low[u]; off-stack them
```

Two things worth naming precisely:
- **One min rule, not two.** The textbook formulation distinguishes tree edges (`min` with the child's *low*) from back edges (`min` with the neighbor's *index*). This implementation uses `min(low[u], low[v])` for **any on-stack neighbor** — the simplified variant (Fiset's, among others). It is **correct for identifying SCCs**: an on-stack neighbor's low always names some vertex in the same still-open region, so components pool to the right roots — though the resulting `low` values aren't textbook low-links (they can undershoot). If you later build *bridges/articulation points*, the distinction returns with teeth: there, using `low` where `index` belongs genuinely breaks the algorithm.
- **`onStack` is the load-bearing guard.** A visited neighbor already assigned to a *finished* SCC must be ignored — otherwise you'd merge components that aren't mutually reachable.

The public API: `sccIds` returns the `low` array after all DFS launches — every member of a component holds its root's discovery index, so equal value ⇔ same component. `sccCount` counts the roots.

### Complexity
O(V + E) — one DFS, optimal, single pass (unlike Kosaraju's two). O(V) for the arrays plus recursion depth.

### Notes
- **Components complete in reverse topological order** of the condensation (the DAG of SCCs). The specific ids are arbitrary — test the *partition* (same-id groups), not the numbers.
- A DAG has V singleton SCCs; a single directed cycle is one SCC of size V. Runner-verified: `{0,1,2},{3,4},{5}` for the linked-cycles graph; DAG → singletons; ring → one component.
- Uses the repo's own `Stack`; state is static (C9); deep graphs recurse deep.


---

## Eulerian_path

**Problem.** Find a trail through a directed graph that uses **every edge exactly once** (an Eulerian path), or determine none exists. Start == end makes it an Eulerian **circuit**. Vertices may repeat; edges may not.

### Idea
Two parts: **check existence** with degree conditions, then **build** the trail with Hierholzer's algorithm.

**Existence (directed).** Compute in/out-degree per vertex (one sweep; the out-degree array will double as the edge pointer). An Eulerian path exists iff at most one vertex has `out − in == +1` (the **start**), at most one has `in − out == +1` (the **end**), every other vertex is balanced, and all edges lie in one connected piece (checked after the walk — below). A lone start without an end (or vice versa), or any vertex off by more than one, rejects immediately. All balanced → circuit.

**Build — as implemented, recursive Hierholzer consuming each list from the back:**
```
dfs(v):
    while out[v] > 0:
        next = adj[v][ out[v] - 1 ]      # out-degree doubles as the edge pointer
        out[v]--                          # consume that edge forever
        dfs(next)
    order.add(0, v)                       # emit on dead-end, PREPENDED
```
Each vertex's remaining out-degree points one past its next unused edge, so edges are taken from the **end of the adjacency list backward** and never rescanned — that monotone pointer is what keeps the walk linear. Emitting a vertex only when it's stuck (post-order) and building the path front-first correctly splices sub-loops together; prepending replaces the usual append-then-reverse.

**Connectivity, as implemented:** after the walk, if **any vertex still has unused out-edges**, the degree conditions held but the edges spanned more than one component — return `[]`. (Equivalent to the `path length == E + 1` test, checked from the other side.) A graph with zero edges returns `[]` up front.

### Complexity
O(V + E) — each edge consumed exactly once, each vertex stuck a bounded number of times. Caveats: `order.add(0, ·)` on an ArrayList is O(path) per emit → O(E²) worst case for the list-building alone (an ArrayDeque prepend fixes it), and the recursion goes as deep as the longest unstuck walk (up to E frames).

### Notes
- **Pick the right start.** A genuine path *must* start at the `out−in == +1` vertex — starting elsewhere strands edges. For a circuit, any vertex **with an out-edge** works.
  **Code flag (B7):** the circuit case hard-codes `start = 0`. If vertex 0 happens to be isolated while a valid circuit lives elsewhere (isolated 0, cycle 1→2→1), the walk consumes nothing and the leftover-edges check rejects a graph that *has* an Eulerian circuit (reproduced). Fix: pick any vertex with `out > 0`.
- **Multi-edges and self-loops are fine** — duplicates in the adjacency list are just multiple edges; the countdown pointer treats each entry as one edge.
- **Undirected variant** swaps the degree rule (path iff 0 or 2 vertices of **odd** degree) and needs each undirected edge marked used from both endpoints; the Hierholzer skeleton is otherwise the same.


---

## Prim_minimum_spanning_tree

**Problem.** Given a connected, weighted, undirected graph, find a **minimum spanning tree** — an edge subset connecting all vertices, acyclic, of smallest total weight.

### Idea
Grow one tree outward. Maintain the set of vertices already in the tree; repeatedly take the **cheapest edge crossing the boundary** (in-tree to out-of-tree), which pulls exactly one new vertex in. A priority queue supplies that minimum crossing edge.

**Lazy Prim, as implemented** (fixed start at vertex 0, `java.util.PriorityQueue` of `(from, to, weight)` ordered by weight):
```
visited[0] = true;  push all edges leaving 0
while pq not empty:
    (from, to, w) = pop-min
    if visited[to]: continue              # stale edge into the tree — discard
    visited[to] = true;  record the edge;  weight += w
    push to's edges leading to unvisited vertices
if any vertex unvisited: disconnected -> weight = NO_SPANNING_TREE, edges = empty
```

**Why the greedy choice is safe (cut property):** for any split of the vertices into in-tree vs out, the minimum-weight crossing edge belongs to some MST. Prim applies this repeatedly to the growing boundary.

**Output shape, as implemented:** the recorded edges are normalized (`u < v` per edge) and sorted by endpoints, so `minimumSpanningEdges` returns a canonical, deterministic `[u, v, w]` list; `minimumSpanningWeight` runs the same routine and reports the accumulated weight — or the `NO_SPANNING_TREE` sentinel (`Long.MAX_VALUE`) for disconnected input. Trivial graphs (0 or 1 vertex) return an empty edge set with weight 0.

### Complexity
Lazy Prim: O(E log E) — every edge may enter the heap once. **Eager Prim** with an indexed PQ (decrease-key: keep only the best crossing edge per outside vertex) is O(E log V) with O(V) heap — the repo's `Indexed_priority_queue` is the exact upgrade part. (No `edgesUsed == n−1` early exit here; the heap just drains — same asymptotics.)

### Notes
- **Skip stale edges** — the lazy heap's analogue of Dijkstra's skip-stale-entry.
- **Disconnected graphs have no spanning tree** — sentinel, not a partial-tree weight.
- **Prim vs Kruskal.** Both ride the cut/cycle properties. Prim grows one tree with a heap (dense-friendly, natural with adjacency lists); Kruskal sorts all edges and unions with union-find (sparse/edge-list-friendly). Same total weight; edge sets can differ under ties.
- **Ties → MST not unique.** Test the *total weight* (and that the returned edges form a spanning tree achieving it), not one specific edge set — the canonical sorted output makes exact-match tests tempting, resist it where ties exist.

## Ford_fulkerson

**Problem.** In a flow network — a directed graph where each edge has a capacity — push as much flow as possible from a **source** to a **sink**, respecting capacities and conserving flow at every other vertex (in = out). Return the maximum total flow.

### Idea
Repeatedly find a source→sink path with spare capacity (an **augmenting path**) and push flow along it, until none remains. The key mechanism is the **residual graph**: alongside each edge's remaining forward capacity, a **reverse residual edge** lets a later path *cancel* earlier flow if that frees a better routing.

**As implemented — generic Ford-Fulkerson with DFS path-finding on an `int[][]` residual matrix:**
```
residual = deep copy of the capacity matrix
while dfs(source, INF) returns f > 0:  maxflow += f;  bump the visit stamp

dfs(node, flow):                        # flow = bottleneck so far
    if node == sink: return flow
    stamp node visited
    for each i with residual[node][i] > 0 and i unstamped:
        f = dfs(i, min(flow, residual[node][i]))
        if f > 0:
            residual[node][i] -= f;  residual[i][node] += f     # forward - , reverse +
            return f
    return 0
```
The bottleneck is threaded *down* the recursion as `min(flow, edge)` and the residual updates happen on the *unwind* — one pass per augmentation, no separate find-then-apply walk. The per-round visited set uses an **integer stamp** (`visited[v] == round#`) so nothing is cleared between rounds. A matrix representation makes reverse residual edges automatic: `residual[v][u]` always exists as a slot, starting at 0 and growing as flow is pushed.

### Complexity
Generic Ford-Fulkerson: **O(E · maxflow)** augmentations-wise — each augmentation raises the flow by ≥ 1 with integer capacities, and a bad DFS order can take that many rounds. On the matrix, each DFS is O(V²), so O(V² · maxflow) here. Fine for small integer capacities (like the bipartite problems below); Edmonds-Karp's BFS choice is what removes the capacity dependence.

### Notes
- **The reverse residual edge is the whole trick.** `residual[i][node] += f` is what lets a later path *undo* a suboptimal earlier commitment; without it a greedy first path can strand the network below the true maximum (the runner's "needs residual reroute" case exercises exactly this).
- **Any augmenting path works for correctness** with integer capacities — the choice of path only affects speed. DFS (here) is the simplest; BFS-shortest is Edmonds-Karp; wide-paths-first is capacity scaling; blocking flows are Dinic's. Irrational capacities can make generic FF fail to terminate — pathological, but the classical reason the refinements exist.
- **Max-flow min-cut theorem:** the max flow equals the capacity of the minimum source/sink cut; after the final failed search, the vertices still reachable from the source in the residual graph form one side of a min cut — a handy way to verify or extract the cut.
- Input validation: square non-null matrix, non-negative capacities, distinct in-range source/sink. State is static (C9).


---

## Edmonds_karp

Ford-Fulkerson that always augments along the **shortest** augmenting path (fewest edges), found by BFS.

### Idea
The only change from generic Ford-Fulkerson is *how the path is picked*: BFS on the residual graph, so each augmenting path has the minimum number of edges. That single choice bounds the work — source-to-sink residual distance never decreases and must increase within O(E) augmentations, capping the total at O(V·E) augmentations.

**As implemented** (same matrix + visit-stamp scaffolding as the DFS version): each round, a BFS from the source records `prev[]` pointers and stops when the sink is dequeued; if the sink was never reached (`prev[t] == −1`), done. Otherwise two backward walks along `prev`: one to take the **minimum residual on the path** (the bottleneck), one to apply it — subtract along forward edges, add along the reverses.

### Complexity
**O(V·E²)** — O(V·E) augmentations × O(E) per BFS (O(V²) per BFS on the matrix, so O(V³·E) matrix-flavored; the bound that matters is that it's **independent of capacity values**). Guaranteed termination even with huge capacities — the fix for plain FF's O(E·maxflow).

### Notes
- **BFS, not DFS, is the whole point.** DFS can pick long, silly paths and take a number of augmentations proportional to the flow value; BFS's shortest paths give the polynomial bound.
- Everything else — residual matrix, reverse edges, bottleneck — is identical to Ford-Fulkerson; here the bottleneck is found and applied in two explicit passes (contrast the DFS version's single recursive pass), which is the natural shape once a `prev[]` chain exists.


---

## Capacity_scaling

Ford-Fulkerson that pushes **large amounts first**: only use augmenting paths whose every edge has residual ≥ a threshold `delta`, halving `delta` as each level exhausts.

### Idea
Set `delta` to the largest power of two ≤ the maximum edge capacity — **as implemented, `Integer.highestOneBit(maxCapacity)`**, with the max capacity gathered during input validation. Repeatedly find augmenting paths restricted to edges with `residual >= delta` and saturate them; when none remain, halve `delta`. At `delta = 1` the restriction disappears and it degenerates into ordinary Ford-Fulkerson, which is exact — so the final flow is maximum.

The path search **as implemented** is the same recursive DFS as the plain Ford-Fulkerson (same matrix, same visit stamps, same on-the-unwind residual updates) with one extra parameter: the edge filter `capacity[node][i] >= delta` instead of `> 0`. The graph searched is always the full residual graph — only which edges the walk may traverse changes.

### Complexity
O(E² log U), `U` = max capacity: each delta-phase adds O(E) augmentations, and there are log U phases. Great when capacities are large but the graph is small — the bulk of the flow moves in a few wide pushes before the algorithm fusses over small residuals.

### Notes
- **Delta phases = the bit-length of the max capacity** — the "process the flow value bit by bit" view of the same idea as the doubling trick in Recursive_multiplication.
- Zero-capacity-everywhere input is handled by clamping the starting delta to ≥ 1 (one vacuous phase, flow 0).

## Dinics

The fast general-purpose max-flow algorithm: alternate **BFS level graphs** with **DFS blocking flows**.

### Idea
Each phase has two steps:
1. **BFS builds the level graph.** From the source, assign every vertex its BFS distance (`level[]`) in the residual graph (unreached = −1). Only edges going from level `L` to level `L+1` count — no shortcuts, no back-edges. If the sink got no level, the flow is maximum: done.
2. **DFS extracts a blocking flow.** Repeatedly push flow source→sink along level-respecting edges (`level[next] == level[node] + 1`) until no augmenting path remains *within this level graph*. Many paths per phase, not one.

**As implemented:** the same residual-matrix scaffolding as the other three, with a `level[]` refilled by BFS each phase, and — the crucial optimization — a per-vertex **current-edge pointer** `next[]` (reset to 0 each phase): the DFS's neighbor loop is `for (; next[node] < V; next[node]++)`, so an edge that proved dead this phase is never rescanned by later DFS attempts. Bottleneck threads down as `min(flow, edge)`; residuals update on the unwind — the Ford-Fulkerson DFS wearing a level-graph seatbelt.

### Complexity
O(V²·E) in general. On **unit-capacity** graphs (including bipartite matching) it's O(E·√V) — why Dinic's is the go-to for matching. Each phase strictly increases the source-sink residual distance, so there are at most V phases.

### Notes
- **Two nested ideas:** BFS gives the level structure (Edmonds-Karp's shortest paths), but instead of one augmentation per BFS, the DFS drains an entire *blocking flow* at that distance before levels are rebuilt. Fewer BFS rebuilds → faster.
- **The current-arc pruning is mandatory for the bound** — re-scanning dead edges every DFS attempt is what it exists to prevent. `level[]` and `next[]` describe *this phase's* residual graph, hence the per-phase reset.
- **Only `level+1` edges in the DFS** — that restriction keeps the search acyclic and guarantees progress; wandering to same- or lower-level vertices would reintroduce cycles.
- **Code flag (C10):** the class still carries `visited`/`visited_count` fields (and bumps the counter) copied over from the FF scaffold — the level-graph + pointer machinery replaced them and nothing reads them. Delete.

## Hamiltonian cycles & NP-hardness

The complexity wall this repo touches at `Traveling_salesman`: what it means, and which famous problems live on the wrong side of it.

### Hamiltonian path / cycle
A **Hamiltonian path** visits every **vertex** exactly once; a **Hamiltonian cycle** additionally returns to its start. The instructive contrast is with the Eulerian path (every **edge** exactly once — implemented in `Algorithms/Eulerian_path`):

| | Eulerian (edges) | Hamiltonian (vertices) |
|---|---|---|
| Existence test | O(V+E) degree conditions | **NP-complete** — no known efficient test |
| Construction | Hierholzer's, O(V+E) | Exponential (brute force / DP over subsets) |

That asymmetry is the whole lesson: two near-identical-sounding questions, one trivially checkable by local degree counting, the other with no known structure to exploit — you essentially must search. Best known exact approaches are backtracking with pruning, or the Held-Karp-style **DP over subsets** in O(2ⁿ·n²) — exactly the `Traveling_salesman` machinery, since TSP is the weighted version of Hamiltonian cycle (Hamiltonian cycle = "is there a tour of cost ≤ k" with unit weights).

### P, NP, NP-complete, NP-hard — the working definitions
- **P** — decision problems solvable in polynomial time.
- **NP** — problems whose *yes*-answers can be **verified** in polynomial time given a certificate (a proposed Hamiltonian cycle is easy to check; finding one is the hard part).
- **NP-complete** — the hardest problems *in* NP: everything in NP reduces to them in polynomial time. Solve any one in polynomial time and P = NP. (SAT was the first, by Cook–Levin; the rest follow by reductions.)
- **NP-hard** — at least as hard as NP-complete, but not required to be in NP itself (needn't be a decision problem, or verifiable). Optimization forms usually sit here: "find the *minimum* tour" is NP-hard; its decision form "is there a tour ≤ k" is NP-complete.

### Common NP-hard problems worth recognizing on sight
- **SAT / 3-SAT** — satisfiability of boolean formulas; the original NP-complete problem and the usual reduction source.
- **Traveling salesman** (min-cost Hamiltonian cycle) — in this repo, exact via Held-Karp O(2ⁿ·n²).
- **Hamiltonian path / cycle** — above.
- **0/1 Knapsack & Subset sum** — NP-complete, *but* pseudo-polynomial: the O(n·W) DP in `Problems/Knapsack_01` is efficient only because W is numerically small; the input size is really the bit-length of W.
- **Graph coloring** (≥ 3 colors; 2-coloring = bipartite check is easy — BFS layer parity).
- **Maximum clique** and **Maximum independent set** — complements of each other.
- **Minimum vertex cover** — NP-hard, though König's theorem makes it polynomial *on bipartite graphs* via max matching (i.e. the max-flow machinery in this repo).
- **Set cover / Steiner tree / Partition / Bin packing** — the classic Karp-21 crowd.

### What to do when a problem is NP-hard
The practical playbook, in the order to try it: (1) **shrink the exponent's base** — subset DP (2ⁿ), meet-in-the-middle (2^(n/2)), branch and bound with pruning; (2) **exploit special structure** — pseudo-polynomial DP when numbers are small (knapsack), polynomial special cases (vertex cover on bipartite graphs, 2-SAT, trees/DAGs generally); (3) **approximate** — e.g. Christofides gives ≤ 1.5× optimal for metric TSP, greedy set cover is ln n-competitive; (4) **heuristics** (local search, simulated annealing) when guarantees can go.

### Notes
- "Exponential" is not "hopeless" — n ≤ 20 is fine for 2ⁿ·n² (Held-Karp's practical range), n ≤ 40 with meet-in-the-middle.
- Recognizing an NP-hard core early saves you from hunting for a polynomial algorithm that (as far as anyone knows) doesn't exist; the interview-relevant skill is naming the reduction ("this is vertex cover in disguise") and then reaching for the playbook above.
